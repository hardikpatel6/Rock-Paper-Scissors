## 🧩 Overview

You play against the computer, each round you pick one of the three options and the computer randomly picks one. Winner is decided with the classic rules.

## 🎮 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hardikpatel6/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git
Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Open index.html in your web browser.

Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors; the computer will make its choice; result (Win/Lose/Draw) appears.

Refresh the page (or click “Restart” if implemented) to play another round.

🌟 Features
✅ Single-player mode (you vs computer)

🎲 Computer choice is random each round

🏆 Win / Lose / Draw detection

🎨 Clean and simple UI

📱 Responsive layout (works on desktop & mobile) — if implemented

⏪ Easy reset for another round

🧠 What I Learned / Demonstrated
Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript (event listeners, updating UI elements)

Implementing game logic and conditional branching for comparing choices

Styling a user interface using CSS3

Project structuring, file management, and deployment basics

Gained confidence in small interactive app development using just frontend technologies

🚀 Future Improvements
Add a score tracker (wins, losses, draws) across rounds

Add animations or transitions when showing results

Implement two-player mode (two humans on same device)

Add single-player AI mode with difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

Use localStorage to persist scores across sessions

Improve UI: themes, custom graphics/icons for choices

Add keyboard controls or gesture support for mobile

🧰 Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
